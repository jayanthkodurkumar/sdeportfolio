  description:
    "My name is Jayanth Kodur Kumar. I’m a Software Developer passionate about designing and building scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems. My core expertise lies in developing production-grade APIs using Python (FastAPI), managing relational data with PostgreSQL, and architecting secure, efficient deployments on AWS. I’ve also worked extensively with Docker, Prisma ORM, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring seamless automation from code to cloud. I enjoy solving complex backend problems — from optimizing database queries and concurrency control to designing distributed microservices and implementing clean, maintainable architectures. At Olei Labs, I lead backend development for a full-featured healthcare SaaS platform, where I migrated legacy systems to FastAPI + PostgreSQL, integrated AWS services, and achieved significant cost and performance improvements. I’m driven by continuous learning and a deep curiosity for system design, cloud architecture, and backend scalability, and I’m always eager to take on challenges that push technical boundaries.",
